Defining **functional** and **non-functional** requirements for a Data-at-Rest Encryption solution is essential to ensure the solution meets both the operational needs and the technical/security standards of the organization. Below is an outline of **how** you might define these requirements, along with typical **examples** you might include.

---

## 1. Functional Requirements

Functional requirements focus on **what** the solution should do, i.e., the capabilities and behaviors needed to fulfill business and security objectives. These may include:

   - **Requirement**: The solution must generate audit logs for all cryptographic operations (key creation, key rotation, data encryption, data decryption, key access, etc.).  
   - **Description**: Detail the information that must be logged, retention policies, and compatibility with existing SIEM systems.

6. **Compliance & Regulatory Requirements**  
   - **Requirement**: The solution must meet all relevant compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, etc.).  
   - **Description**: Outline the specific data protection requirements from each regulation and how the encryption solution should align with them (e.g., tokenization for PCI, data masking for GDPR, etc.).

7. **Backup & Recovery**  
   - **Requirement**: The system must support secure backup and recovery of encrypted data, including encryption keys.  
   - **Description**: Define how keys and encrypted data are backed up, the required RTO/RPO, and how to recover data if a key is lost or compromised.

8. **Scalability of Encryption Services**  
   - **Requirement**: The solution must handle the current and projected volume of encryption operations (e.g., peak workloads, large file encryption).  
   - **Description**: Indicate current and forecast data volumes, anticipated number of encryption requests per second, etc.

9. **Transparency for End Users**  
   - **Requirement**: The encryption process must not require manual intervention by end-users or significantly alter their workflows.  
   - **Description**: Define how the solution will be “transparent” to front-end users (e.g., database-level or file-system-level encryption).

10. **Administration & Configuration**  
    - **Requirement**: The solution must provide a management console or interface to configure encryption policies, manage keys, monitor usage, etc.  
    - **Description**: Describe the need for a centralized dashboard or CLI/API to handle administration, manage configurations, and generate metrics.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define the **quality attributes** of the solution—how well it performs under various conditions and how it integrates into the organization’s environment. These typically cover:

1. **Performance**  
   - **Requirement**: The solution must not introduce unacceptable latency or degrade performance beyond a defined threshold (e.g., max 5% overhead on database transactions).  
   - **Description**: Detail acceptable performance metrics (throughput, latency) under normal and peak loads, and how performance will be measured.

2. **Reliability & High Availability**  
   - **Requirement**: The encryption/KMS solution must be highly available, with minimal downtime in case of component failure.  
   - **Description**: Define acceptable SLAs (e.g., 99.9% uptime), architecture for redundancy, failover mechanisms, and disaster recovery scenarios.

3. **Security & Hardening**  
   - **Requirement**: The solution must adhere to secure deployment practices, including network segmentation, encrypted communications (TLS), and hardened operating systems.  
   - **Description**: Specify requirements for secure deployment configurations, regular vulnerability assessments, and patching schedules.

4. **Scalability & Elasticity**  
   - **Requirement**: The solution must support horizontal or vertical scaling as data volumes or transaction rates grow.  
   - **Description**: Document peak data growth rates, expected capacity increases, and how the solution should scale (e.g., cloud auto-scaling, on-prem cluster expansions).

5. **Maintainability**  
   - **Requirement**: The solution must be maintainable and upgradable with minimal downtime and risk.  
   - **Description**: Indicate the need for easy patching/upgrades, well-documented processes, and vendor support channels.

6. **Usability**  
   - **Requirement**: The administrative interfaces and processes (key creation, policy management) must be intuitive and user-friendly.  
   - **Description**: Define required training, documentation standards, and user interface expectations.

7. **Monitoring & Alerting**  
   - **Requirement**: The system must provide real-time monitoring and alerting for critical events (e.g., key compromise, key store failure).  
   - **Description**: Specify integration with existing monitoring tools (e.g., Splunk, Grafana), define thresholds for alerts, and response workflows.

8. **Interoperability**  
   - **Requirement**: The encryption/KMS solution must integrate with the organization’s existing identity management, ticketing, and operations toolsets.  
   - **Description**: Define integrations (e.g., Active Directory, Kerberos, ServiceNow) and any relevant APIs or plugins that must be supported.

9. **Regulatory & Audit Readiness**  
   - **Requirement**: The solution’s logs and audit trails must be tamper-evident and easily exportable for regulatory or internal audits.  
   - **Description**: Document how logs are secured, retention requirements, and how audit data can be presented to regulators.

10. **Cost & Licensing**  
   - **Requirement**: The solution must fit within budget constraints and have a transparent licensing model that supports the organization’s growth.  
   - **Description**: Define CAPEX/OPEX constraints, cost per seat/server, or usage-based licensing if applicable.

## 3. Steps to Define and Document Requirements

1. **Gather Stakeholder Input**  
   - Conduct interviews and workshops with key stakeholders (Security, Compliance, Legal, IT Operations, Application Owners) to understand their needs.  
   - Align requirements with the organization’s strategic goals (e.g., risk reduction, compliance, cost optimization).

2. **Map to Industry & Regulatory Standards**  
   - Cross-reference internal requirements with external standards (e.g., NIST 800-53, PCI DSS, GDPR).  
   - Ensure the chosen requirements cover baseline security controls.

3. **Prioritize Requirements**  
   - Label each requirement as “Must Have,” “Should Have,” or “Nice to Have,” allowing the project team to balance scope and resources.  
   - Use a requirements traceability matrix to map each requirement to a corresponding test or acceptance criterion.

4. **Validate & Finalize**  
   - Circulate the draft requirements with stakeholders for feedback.  
   - Finalize and baseline the requirements document as an official reference for solution selection and PoC evaluation.

5. **Incorporate Requirements into Evaluation & PoC**  
   - Use the functional/non-functional requirements to create a vendor selection or solution scoring matrix.  
   - Test critical requirements in the Proof of Concept to ensure viability.
